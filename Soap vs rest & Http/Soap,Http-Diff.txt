Wsdl:-
wsdl is a web service description language it is used to give api specification i.e input and output with the base uri and operation

Wsdl has 

<types>: What data types will be transmitted? (Nothing but schema defination input and output)
<message>: What messages will be transmitted?  (its alias of request and response)
<portType>: What operations will be supported?  (what all operation is there )
<binding>: How will the messages be transmitted   (which protocol will be used for transfer http or smtp)
 on the wire?
<service>: Where is the service located?  (actual location of the service)

abstract wsdl will have(type,message,porttype)
concrete wsdl (binding,service)
