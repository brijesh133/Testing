Munit is used to check the functinality it is used its not for performance testing

inside munit Test there are behavoir ,exceution and validation

if we are manulayy writing the test case then we need a component called set event where we can set the event with payload,attributes,error,variable to start a test case we need
a set event

validation is nothing but to validate the Actual result with expected result 

 some of the compoent of validation are

  1:-Asset equal take actal and expected value

2:-Assert that which works with dw function and return matcher object some of the function 
Expression :Actual payload comes from flow
is :notnullvalue()
is: null value()
is:equalto()
is:greaterthan
is:greaterthanorequalto

3:-Assert Expression : where we need to give expression 
 Expression:-

 payload must notbenull()
 payload must beArray()
 payload must equalTo()
 payload must contain()

4:verify call :-we can check that particular component in flow got exactly one call or not its basically test the call


Behavoir:- in the behavoir section we will have like mock when and spy operation where mock will be used for instead of calling a component it will use its own value which
will be specified in mock when
ex: if a component is calling a database component if suppose is service down that does'nt mean test is failes so we will mock that and will use for sucees response

spy is used to spy before the payload of execution of component and after exceution of component is as expected

for mock and spy we need to choose the processor that means a database or transformation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
munit opration:set event,after test,before test,before suite,after suite and test
munit tools operation:-assert equal,assert that,assert expression,verify call,spy.mock when

working of before test and before suite:
before test means it will run for each test in suite where as before suite it will run only once for whole test suite

componet are
behavoir,exceution,validation

behavoir is used for mockwhen,spy
exceution for set event and call flow reference
validation is used to test expected value over actual
