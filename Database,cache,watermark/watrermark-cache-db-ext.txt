upsert: it will take array of object if we say contact we need to update or insert if update based on email or id if email present in payload then it will update if not insert 
in salesforce it will insert and if we don't pass id itself then it will directly insert insted of error

upsert if we don't pass key field also it will treat it as new record and insert in case of update if there is not id it will throw errro

output will show response whether created:true if email not present if not present it will be created false and modify true

update:- it will take an id only to update if id not passed it will throw error to pass id input is array of object

on new object:it will keep on pooling the for new object if any object comes it will pool and value will be in payload as a java object, when we first insert a object 
it will trigger on new object as well as on new modified also because it is newly created.
