Day 09 redilvery

In the reliability pattern it is used for no data/message loss

until succesfull is used there is chaces of unstable server so we will put under the scope of until successfull and give retry attempt and delay between retry if it
fails after retry then it will give error
until succesfully is used to run the flow until its successfiull by giving max retry and delay between the retry when its fails

reconnection strtegy :- if suppose connection issue is there to connected to database or any this strategy make sure it retry to create connection for speffied no of times
given in  max entries and deplyas between it

NoteL-difference between until success and reconnection strategy is if we click the checbox fail while deployment also it reconnection strategy will check that during deployment whether able
to connect database or not also it will check after deployement also connection able to establiish or not

redilvery policy :- it used in mainly listner of jms where if in flows get error in component anywhere it should deliver the same message again by spefied time and delay in connector of jms
and to make sure complete flow executes once we use transaction so that either meesage should be commited or no message should be commited.


Transaction:- when any component supports transaction it makes sure message are not lost any where


Note:what if after redilvery of message reach to max at that time message will be loss for that we need snd jms message publish in the form of persistent message 
so that after max redilvery persistent make sure that message should move dead letter queue so that message cannot be lost by sending in the form persistent message.


we use Acquisition flow and processing flow we use in reliability pattern for no meesaage loss.

it means when client sends a data it shoulf not be loss the http listener source event should pass the message to jms queue and processing flow will execute business logic
connecting to database and other if third party system is there and it is down we will use transaction so that either the whole s commited or no commit is happened in flow
so there will be no message loss and message will move dead letter queue and can be porcesssed later.
