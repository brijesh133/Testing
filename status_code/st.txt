whenever we are calling a request component at that we can get a status code and payload of third party api when error occurs we can get status code and payload by usnin
below expression error.muleMessage.payload to get a payload, where as to get status code we can use error.muleMessage.attributes.statusCode

also we can configure the status code for error and success response by creating a variable in like vars. http and set that with required status code and in http listener
response keep that variable name. same for success follow same.

if in scatter gatter we get error it will stop there itself also if there is any variable inside scatter gatter and error occurs then when it throws error at that time
varible will be deleted only payload will be there which was before scatter gatter processing if we use on error continue at that variable will exist because on error
continue act as nothing happend and variable will be there which was declared in scatter gatter.

if we want to show error of scatter gatter only way is to use on error continue and set the payload of error.discription or error.mulemessage.payload. so that when final
output is ready for that route it will show error message

the variable which is declare outside the scatter gatter will exist even after on error propagate is there in scatter gatter for handling error.
